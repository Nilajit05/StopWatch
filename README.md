# StopWatch 
Project Name: Stopwatch App 
This project involves creating a digital stopwatch app using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. The app has a circular design and includes features like start, stop, reset buttons, a unique animated background, and stop and restart timers.
Features Overview: Circular Design: The stopwatch app has a circular layout that adds to its visual appeal and makes it stand out.
Animated background: The background app has an animated gradient effect that provides a wonderful visual experience to users. 
Start, Stop, Reset button: Users can control the stop time with intuitive buttons.The "Start" button starts the timer, the "Stop" button stops the timer, and the "Reset" button sets the timer back to zero.

How to use: Clone Repository: Users can use the Git clone command to clone the repository to their local machine. 
Open Directory.html: The user can access the Stopwatch application interface by opening the index.html file in the web browser. 
Start, Stop and Restart: Click the "Start" button to start the timer. Press "Stop" to pause the time or "Reset" to reset it to zero. 
Pause and restart: If the timer is stopped, clicking "Start" again will restart from the time it was stopped, allowing the user to pick up where he left off.
